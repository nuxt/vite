# Build

From v0.2.0, we shipped experimental build support with Vite. It's disable by default and you can enable it by setting `vite.build: true` in config.

```js
// nuxt.config
export default {
  buildModules: [
    'nuxt-vite'
  ],
  vite: {
    build: true
  }
}
```

Then run `nuxt build` with the power of Vite!
