# 🤔 How it works

Nuxt has a powerful hooking system to extend internals. Default bundler ([@nuxt/webpack](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/tree/dev/packages/webpack)) can be replaced by a nuxt module. `nuxt-vite` replaces webpack by a similar interface to use vite instead of webpack.

Client-side modules are loaded on demand using vite middleware.

Server-side bundle is being created by another vite instance and written to filesystem and passed using hooks to nuxt server-renderer.
Current approach is not the most efficient way due to usage of filesystem, extra build and lack of lazy loading,
yet much faster than webpack builds. You can opt-out of SSR build using `nuxt dev --spa`.
