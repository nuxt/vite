# Tips for module authors

You can start adding experimental vite support to your modules, considering there are known issues and potential breaking changes.

Here are some tips:

- Avoid depending on webpack features (like loaders) as much as possible
- Avoid depending on vite plugins that do not have webpack alternative since we still use webpack for production build
- Avoid directly depending on either webpack or vite, but if had to, consider supporting both
- Extend nuxt build options like `alias` and `build.transpile` in your modules. This way nuxt can do bundler-level config based on generic options

## Hooks

You can either extend vite config by extending `nuxt.options.vite` in module or using hooks

### `vite:extend`

```ts
nuxt.hook('vite:extend', ({ config, nuxt, builder }) => { })
```

Called one time with vite context and default shared config merged with user config

### `vite:extendConfig`

```ts
nuxt.hook('vite:extendConfig', (config, { isClient, isServer }) => { })
```

Called two times. Once with resolved client config and once with resolved server config.
Use it to apply client/server specific extension.

### `vite:serverCreated`

```ts
nuxt.hook('vite:serverCreated', (viteServer) => { })
```

Called one time with vite server once it has been created.
