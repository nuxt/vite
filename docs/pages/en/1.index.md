[Vite](https://vitejs.dev) (pronounced 'veet') is a no-bundler alternative to webpack made by Vue.js author, Evan You.

Using native ES modules, it provides **instant server start** and **lightning fast HMR** development experience.

This package allows using Vite instead of Webpack during development with [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/)

:::alert{type="warning"}
**ðŸ§ª Vite mode is experimental and many nuxt modules are still incompatible. If you find a bug, please report via [issues](https://github.com/nuxt/vite/issues) with a minimal reproduction**
